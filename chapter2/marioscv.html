        <h3>Profil</h3>
            <p class="profil-text"> 
                With 20 years of experience in the Hellenic Navy, as a Naval Officer, I was involved in several projects such us Food Suplly for Hellenic Navy and Material Supply for  the construction of warships where I played a leading role in negotiating with various companies. I learned to be highly flexible and adaptive in order to cope with diversified working environments. Furthermore, strict deadlines and frameworks made me realize the importance of being able to deliver error free working papers and projects on time. I currently serve as Financial Director of the Public Entity - AOAA, which financially exploits its real estate, implements construction projects and provides loans to its members. I am responsible for the budgeting and accounting of the Organazation’s operations and services, as well as providing financial support and guidance to a team of 12 persons.
                I am passionated with Computer Science and  I am attending my M.Sc. in Information Systems. My goal is to obtain the necessary foundations in order to deal professionally with my passion at ΙΤ.
